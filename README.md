`added validator format for datetime with timezone (date-timeZ)`

# jsonschema
Simple and fast [JSON schema](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03) validator.

## Usage

### Simple
Simple object validation using JSON schemas.

```javascript
  var v = new Validator();
  var instance = 4;
  var schema = {"type": "number"};
  console.log(v.validate(instance, schema));
```

### Even simpler

```javascript
  var validate = require('jsonschema').validate;
  console.log(validate(4, {"type": "number"}));
```

### Complex example, with split schemas and references

```javascript
  var v = new Validator();

  // Address, to be embedded on Person
  var addressSchema = {
    "id": "/SimpleAddress",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "lines": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "zip": {"type": "string"},
      "city": {"type": "string"},
      "country": {"type": "string", "required": true}
    }
  };

  // Person
  var schema = {
    "id": "/SimplePerson",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {"type": "string"},
      "address": {"$ref": "/SimpleAddress"},
      "votes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1}
    }
  };

  var p = {
    "name": "Barack Obama",
    "address": {
      "lines": [ "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest" ],
      "zip": "DC 20500",
      "city": "Washington",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "votes": "lots"
  };

  var v = new Validator();
  v.addSchema(addressSchema, '/SimpleAddress');
  console.log(v.validate(p, schema));
```
